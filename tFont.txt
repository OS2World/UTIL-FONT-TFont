    TFont v1.0, by Tomas ™gren
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    What is this?
    -------------
    This is only a program to change the default font in fullscreen OS/2
    sessions to one of your own. It currently reads raw fonts (like Linux
    uses), ie a file with all 256 chars, and one bit per "pixel", 8 columns
    and 16 rows (80x25 mode). The filesize is (256*8*16/8 =) 4096 bytes.
    I have only tested it with 80x25 fonts, so I cannot say if it will work
    with other sizes. All the program does, is to use the VioGetFont(),
    fill the font-data buffer with the data from a file, and put it all back
    with VioSetFont(). All other parts of the data (x-size, y-size etc) is
    unchanged.
    I included a DOS version too (not too much features in that one..)


    NOTE:
    -----
    I have tested this program on a couple of computers, and gotten help to
    test it by some people on IRC (See "Thanx" below for a list), and it seems
    like some video-drivers doesn't support the Vio?etFont() call, and fails.
    There is nothing I can do about this, except to bypass the drivers and
    talk directly to the gfx-card, but then the font will change back as soon
    as something changes videomode, and it isn't really that way you should
    program in an OS (Im not counting DOS as a real OS). So, I won't do that.


    What's included in the archive?
    -------------------------------
    Well.. There should be about 8 files..:
    tFont.Doc           This thing
    tFont.Exe           The OS/2 executable
    tFont.c             The source
    tFont.def           File used while compiling
    Fonts.Zip           Some fonts ripped from Linux (Unpack the ones you like)
    file_id.diz         Short desc for BBS's
    Makefile            The makefile..
    dosFont.Exe         Stupid Dos version, executable
    dosFont.c           Stupid Dos version, source


    How to run?
    -----------
    Usage:  tFont.exe [-?|-h|-d|-f] <Filename>
            <Filename>          Installs the font <Filename>
            -f                  Force yes on all questions
            -d                  Display status only
            -?                  This help
            -h                  This help

    With the parameter -d, it only queries which fontsize and total bytes
    needed for the font, and prints it on the screen.

    -f forces yes to all questions (currently only 1, if the bytes needed and
    bytes in the file doesn't match), should normally never be used, but.


    Example:
    --------
    tFont.Exe T.Fnt                        (Changes to T.Fnt, my favourite)

    or
    tFont.Exe T.Fnt >NUL         (If you want to run it at startup or so..)

    I have included a couple of fonts which I have stolen (?) from Linux


    Thanx to:
    ---------
    IBM for their great OS/2!
    Bill G. for "640kb should be..."
    Christoper, Erik, Magnus for testing my program.
    Deek, roland and jez333 on IRC (#os2prog) for also testing...


    Final word(s):
    --------------
    This program is e-mailware! (If you wish to use the program for more than
    10 years, you have to send me an email.. :] )
    Mail me if you like the program, hate the program, find a bug, missing
    feature, nothing to do for the moment  etc..
    I am also interrested in more fonts.. (80x25, 80x50 etc..)
    "Textmode is still alive" (Should be sung with "James Brown is still alive"
    melody)

Enhancements in v1.2:
====================
X) It works!  (A buffer was crossing 64K-boundary.)

X) Supports arbitrary sizes of the charbox.

X) new options -w to write a file, -s to choose the size (and possibly
   the output filename) automatically (run without args to get more details).

X) A script maketables.cmd will create font files for all the resolutions
   your FS sessions support.

X) A Perl script show_glyph.pl to visualize/edit the table is included.  Run

    perl show_glyph.pl HH font-file.fnt > outfile

   to emit the editable table, HH is the height of the font.  Import the
   table by running 

    perl show_glyph.pl -w HH font-file.fnt outfile

Here is how to change the screen font to cp866  (or any other codepage)
==============================================

a) Find an OS/2 system which has codepage 866 enabled, or boot your system with

    CODEPAGE=866,850

   in config.sys.

b) Change to a FS session, check whether 866 is active by running

    chcp

   if not, run

    chcp 866

c) Run maketables.cmd.  You may want to repeat this with the second codepage
   prepared on the same system.

d) Transfer the generated directory "dir" to your computer (or change the
   CODEPAGE line in CONFIG.SYS back and reboot).  Now running

    tFont -s x:/path/to/dir cp866.fnt

   in a fullscreen session will switch the display font to cp866.
